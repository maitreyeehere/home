hi :D

i'm a </b>computer science and engineering</b> undergraduate at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), Bhubaneswar, India. 

i love learning, and what i really love about my subject is how creative you can get it with, and how it intersects with pretty much everything (for example, how brains work) and helps us understand it better.

while i am yet to explore many domains of my subject, so far i have taken a strong interest in <b>data science</b>, <b>data management</b>, <b>computer vision</b>, <b>natural language processing</b>, <b>computer architecture and high performance computing</b>, <b>computational geometry</b> and <b>statistics</b>. i am aspiring for a career in research and teaching, and i'm actively looking for more hands-on research opportunities in university and industry research labs in india and abroad. 

welcome to my portfolio. here's where you will find what courses i've done, projects i've worked on, previous work experience and what i'm looking forward to as a student.

<b>october 2024</b> 

i'm halfway through my fifth semester of btech!

<b>july 2024</b>

earlier this year, i completed a summer internship at the dept. of computer science and engineering, IIT Kharagpur, under Prof Partha Bhowmick. my work was on <b>geometric analysis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandala">mandala</a> in the context of computational art</b>. 

this was an incredibly rewarding opportunity for me as my very first foray into a research environment in real time. i also participated in communicating a paper to the International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024.
